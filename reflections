/*

reflections:

good practice for many different JS methods
learned new methods like the do-while loop to make my code more clean and concise
learned how to make code more concise

difficulties:

had to figure out how to keep the shit on the screen
therefore had to learn how to use JS to prevent code from being affected by HTML-affecting code
spent lots of time figuring out I had to clear the interval
spent lots of time learning function syntax of new functions to apply to the code
had to modify the do while loops quite a bit to make them as water-tight as possible
had to learn the difference between calculation/game logic and actually putting things on the screen
originally had 3 levels and tried different speeds but that was too complicated
